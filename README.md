# Hmm

- Download to mp3 worked for a small video [walldog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZpa3nOLOa8)
- Did not work for a longer video [Oh Sees - Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=9pMXwwcX-K4)
	- The download did work (it took a long time)
	- But I couldnt open the resulting mp3 file in iTunes, QuickTime or VLC

That's all for now. Nice nice, seeya bye :)
